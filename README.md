# Ruby TDD

> This is a project from the fourth week of the fourth module of the Microverse Program.

In this project we learned how to exercise Test Driven Development (TDD). The project consists in a class named `Solver` that contains three methods, `factorial`, `reverse`, and `fizzbuzz`. Unit tests for each method were written before the methods.

> Each of the classes was created in a different `rb` file.
